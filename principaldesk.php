  <p>Late President APJ Abdul Kalam Said, "Those who dared to imagine the impossible are the ones who break all the human limitations. Answering to the question of Class 5 Student, he said "The major strength of India is the youth, 600 million youths. Ignited minds of the youths are the most powerful resource on the earth, above the earth and under the earth and weakness of India is that failure, of not having vision.
 In order to achieve your dreams, you may have to face a lot of difficulties especially during these days of pandemic, as you have your online studies, there are a lot of hurdles which you have to face such as lack of device, interruption in between the classes due to network issues, the environment at home etc. But still dear children those who dare to dream, do the impossible , possible.<br>
Regardless of what is going on in the world or challenges that present themselves, a vision helps you know what and why you are doing the things you are doing Having a vision is most important in the path of your success in life. You feel much more valuable as a person when you set and achieve visions and goals. A vision might be the most powerful way to keep you focused on: what you want in life while keeping you motivated in achieving it.<br>

So dear Children, as you study and move forward with a resilient spirit to fulfil your dreams and make your parents proud and happy, do not forget to be a good human being. We know that the past year and months have brought in a lot of misery, unhappiness and misfortune to many. Let us be aware of the poor, the under privileged, the less fortunate, and try to help them whenever possible. These days you are at home, so do not become a burden to your parents and elders. Help them, listen to them, do not waste time in doing or watching useless things, rather invest your time in doing something innovative, creative and worthwhile that will be beneficial to you, for your future endeavor.<br>

"The world of great opportunity is available now, as it has always been, only for those with great vision" â€“ Andrew Carnegie<br><br>
