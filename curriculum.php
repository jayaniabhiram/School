  A Pre-Primary means “children’s garden”, a preschool educational approach where the children should be ‘nurtured and nourished’ like plants in a garden
which is based around playing, singing, practical activities, and social interaction as part of the transition from home to school.
We believe that, young minds can absorb an amazing amount of information and concepts especially when they are presented in a positive manner and in
a free atmosphere. The need is to develop a surrounding which is full of fun and devoid of any threats or embarrassment. Learning and growing should be
a fun. So every opportunity should be given which improves their self-esteem and nourishes their growth. We want them to feel protected and grow as
independent individuals. Our aim is to expose children to the kind of stimulating experiences with healthy mental growth, motor development and writing
readiness.
Fun with numbers will develop analytical and logical reasoning. At pre-primary stage the expected outcome can be summarised as: cognitive development,
enhancement of vocabulary, inter-personal skills, readiness, recognition of numbers, promotion of knowledge, understanding, development of skills,
development of personal & social skills, gross motor development & age appropriate values.
